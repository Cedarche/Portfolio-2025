Snap Park is my latest and most developed endevour, I built it to solve a common problem among many companies - office parking spot availability.

<Image src={hero} alt="The Snap Park Landing page." />

What started as a simple experiment with QR codes quickly developed into 4-6 month obsession where I spent every moment outside work hours developing a fully functional SaaS product - complete with detailed landing page, thorough onboarding process, billing, and a functional dashboard.

## The Problem

At my previous job we had 20 employees who drove to work, and only 6 available carparks in the office. However, as it was a multi-story carpark, there was no way of knowing if there were still spots available before driving all the way up to check. Unless you were there bright and early, you enevitably found yourself frustrated, fighting your way back down against oncoming traffic, only to then have to seek out some kind of alternative parking (in a busy business district).

While Snap Park doesnt aleviate the issue of parking spot
availability, it at least saves you the hassle and time of getting
stuck in an already full office carpark.

Having just recently built Assetrix for a client at work, I was
inspired by how easy it was to use QR codes for inventory
management, and was looking for other ways I could utilise them.
The premise of Snap Park is quite simple, I placed QR code
stickers like the one below on each of our carparks, when an
employee arrives at work and takes an available park, they then
scan the adjacent code and mark it as unavailable on it's
associated webpage. When all carparks are taken, a text message is
sent out to all employees enrolled in the system that the work
carpark is now full, and that they should seek alternative
parking.
