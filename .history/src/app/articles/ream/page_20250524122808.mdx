This is the very first project I started back in 2019, and through
it I've learnt to use React, React Native, Node.js, PCB design, and
a range of accessory frameworks.

The concept of Ream is simple, nobody likes paper receipts. While
most people don't give receipts a second thought, I, like many
others, was required to keep a record of all purchases made
through work so they could be expensed back. Simple bank
transaction statements were not enough. I found it astounding that
in 2019, there was no direct interface between the Point of Sale
(POS) systems and the payment processing providers for receipt
data that wasn't just the sales total.

So I decided I would try and build a solution. My initial idea was
some kind of middleware that would integrate with existing POS
software and the customer's banking app to provide an interface
for the receipt data mentioned above (I still think this is the
best solution). However, the industry integrations required for a
system like this seemed too ambitious for a first project.

My next solution was a physical device (think Square Card Reader)
that would sit on a businesses counter top and emulate a standard
bluetooth receipt printer. When a customer made a purchase, their
receipt would be 'printed' to the device which I named the Ream
Tile, which would then make a request to my backend, storing all
necessary information, and returning with a URL. The customer
then taps the Tile with an NFC enabled mobile phone, opens the URL,
and can view/store the digital receipt.

The system I ended up building consists of 4 components:

<ul className="mt-6 space-y-6">
  <li className="flex items-center gap-3">
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Main Web App</strong> - This would
      be the starting point for users, when they first tap a Ream Tile, the
      received URL would render their receipt in the browser as shown below.
      There is a simple interface where users can register an account, then
      store/retrieve their receipts.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Mobile Application</strong> - Using
      deep linking, the same URL can instead open up the receipt in a native
      mobile application, which provides a more fluid experience for the user.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Backend</strong> — All of the
      receipt data received from the POS system is sent from the Tile to the
      server via MQTT. A series of serverless AWS lambda functions then
      store/process the data before returning a URL to the Tile.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Hardware</strong> — The Tile itself
      is something I'm quite proud of. It's completely built from scratch, and
      uses a custom PCB that uses an ESP32-C3 microcontroller at it's core. It
      has built in battery management/charging, and a custom housing that can be
      3D printed (or injection moulded).
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>

## The main Ream Website

This was the first website I ever built, so you'll have to excuse some
of the styling. I have refactored it over the years to use typescript,
however much of the original code is fairly low-quality.

<Image src={homepage} alt="The Ream landing page." />

The website is primarily designed to be viewed on mobile, as the
majority of the customers would access it via their digital receipt in
order to learn more about the system. I also built a simple notification
system that would let takeaway venues notify their customers when their
order was ready for collection by updating the receipt, which I called
dynamic receipts. An example of standard, and dynamic digital receipts
can be seen below.
