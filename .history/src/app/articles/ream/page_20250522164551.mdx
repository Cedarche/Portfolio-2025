This is the very first project I started back in 2019, and through
it I've learnt to use React, React Native, Node.js, PCB design, and
a range of accessory frameworks.

The concept of Ream is simple, nobody likes paper receipts. While
most people don't give receipts a second thought, I, like many
others, was required to keep a record of all purchases made
through work so they could be expensed back. Simple bank
transaction statements were not enough. I found it astounding that
in 2019, there was no direct interface between the Point of Sale
(POS) systems and the payment processing providers for receipt
data that wasn't just the sales total.
