This is the very first project I started back in 2019, and through
it I've learnt to use React, React Native, Node.js, PCB design, and
a range of accessory frameworks.

The concept of Ream is simple, nobody likes paper receipts. While
most people don't give receipts a second thought, I, like many
others, was required to keep a record of all purchases made
through work so they could be expensed back. Simple bank
transaction statements were not enough. I found it astounding that
in 2019, there was no direct interface between the Point of Sale
(POS) systems and the payment processing providers for receipt
data that wasn't just the sales total.

So I decided I would try and build a solution. My initial idea was
some kind of middleware that would integrate with existing POS
software and the customer's banking app to provide an interface
for the receipt data mentioned above (I still think this is the
best solution). However, the industry integrations required for a 
system like this seemed too ambitious for a first project.

My next solution was a physical device (think Square Card Reader)
that would sit on a businesses counter top and emulate a standard
bluetooth receipt printer. When a customer made a purchase, their
receipt would be 'printed' to the device which I named the Ream
Tile, which would then make a request to my backend, storing all
necessary information, and returning with a URL. The customer
then taps the Tile with an NFC enabled mobile phone, opens the URL,
and can view/store the digital receipt.

The system I ended up building consists of 4 components:
