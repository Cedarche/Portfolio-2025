At it's core, Cross Copy just provides a simple way to avoid having
to email text and files to yourself. It works in a similar way to
Google Drive or Dropbox, but without the bloat of folders,
subscriptions, or size limits.

As with most of my projects, I built Cross Copy to overcome a
common problem that I encountered at work. Part of my previous job
was to create and deliver weekly (sometimes daily) reports which
included photos of the work that had been completed on a job-site.
Since I was using an iPhone, and my work computer was a Windows, I
used to simply email the photos to myself. However, the 20MB limit
on emails is quite limiting when each photo is 6MB+ each.
Additionally, sending files/photo/url links from my personal Mac
to my work PC was a pain.

This is obviously not a new problem, and there are dozens if not
hundreds of solutions out there already, most of which are better
than Cross Copy and offer more features. I decided to build it
myself, 1. because I wanted to see if I could do it, and 2.
because I found using common services like Google Drive or Dropbox
to be cumbersome, with honestly too many features.

Cross Copy is the simplest service I have come across, a basic
interface that works well on mobile and desktop, no storage or
folders (files are automatically deleted after 7 days), and no
account/subscription required. I even built a Chrome extension
which means you don't even have to open the webpage to access your
files.

The system is broken up into 3 parts:

<ul className="mt-6 space-y-6">
  <li className="flex items-center gap-3">
    <CloudArrowUpIcon className="h-7 w-7 text-indigo-600" aria-hidden="true" />
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Main Web App</strong> — Transfer
      text, photos, and files directly in the browser from any device.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <CloudArrowUpIcon className="h-7 w-7 text-indigo-600" aria-hidden="true" />
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Main Web App</strong> - Allows you to
      share photos and files directly from your mobile device to Cross Copy.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <ServerIcon className="h-7 w-7 text-indigo-600" aria-hidden="true" />
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Chrome Extension</strong> —
      Instantly access copied text, files, and photos right from the Chrome
      toolbar.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>

It uses Firebase Authentication, Storage, and Firestore, which are
accessed directly on the client side using carefully set rules.
