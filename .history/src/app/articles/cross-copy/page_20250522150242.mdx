At it's core, Cross Copy just provides a simple way to avoid having
to email text and files to yourself. It works in a similar way to
Google Drive or Dropbox, but without the bloat of folders,
subscriptions, or size limits.

As with most of my projects, I built Cross Copy to overcome a
common problem that I encountered at work. Part of my previous job
was to create and deliver weekly (sometimes daily) reports which
included photos of the work that had been completed on a job-site.
Since I was using an iPhone, and my work computer was a Windows, I
used to simply email the photos to myself. However, the 20MB limit
on emails is quite limiting when each photo is 6MB+ each.
Additionally, sending files/photo/url links from my personal Mac
to my work PC was a pain.
