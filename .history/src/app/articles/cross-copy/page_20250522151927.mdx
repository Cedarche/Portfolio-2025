At it's core, Cross Copy just provides a simple way to avoid having
to email text and files to yourself. It works in a similar way to
Google Drive or Dropbox, but without the bloat of folders,
subscriptions, or size limits.

As with most of my projects, I built Cross Copy to overcome a
common problem that I encountered at work. Part of my previous job
was to create and deliver weekly (sometimes daily) reports which
included photos of the work that had been completed on a job-site.
Since I was using an iPhone, and my work computer was a Windows, I
used to simply email the photos to myself. However, the 20MB limit
on emails is quite limiting when each photo is 6MB+ each.
Additionally, sending files/photo/url links from my personal Mac
to my work PC was a pain.

This is obviously not a new problem, and there are dozens if not
hundreds of solutions out there already, most of which are better
than Cross Copy and offer more features. I decided to build it
myself, 1. because I wanted to see if I could do it, and 2.
because I found using common services like Google Drive or Dropbox
to be cumbersome, with honestly too many features.

Cross Copy is the simplest service I have come across, a basic
interface that works well on mobile and desktop, no storage or
folders (files are automatically deleted after 7 days), and no
account/subscription required. I even built a Chrome extension
which means you don't even have to open the webpage to access your
files.

The system is broken up into 3 parts:

<ul className="mt-6 space-y-6">
  <li className="flex items-center gap-3">
    <CloudArrowUpIcon className="h-7 w-7 text-indigo-600" aria-hidden="true" />
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Main Web App</strong> — Transfer
      text, photos, and files directly in the browser from any device.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <CloudArrowUpIcon className="h-7 w-7 text-indigo-600" aria-hidden="true" />
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Main Web App</strong> - Allows you
      to share photos and files directly from your mobile device to Cross Copy.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <ServerIcon className="h-7 w-7 text-indigo-600" aria-hidden="true" />
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Chrome Extension</strong> —
      Instantly access copied text, files, and photos right from the Chrome
      toolbar.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>

It uses Firebase Authentication, Storage, and Firestore, which are
accessed directly on the client side using carefully set rules.
All of the source code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/Cedarche/CrossCopy" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

## The main web app

The easiest way to use the service is to simply open the website <a href="https://crosscopy.dev/" target="_blank">crosscopy.dev</a> in a browser. Users can either choose to create an account, or continue anonymously with a linking code. They're then taken to the main homepage as seen below where they can paste text or add files.

Anything added to the homepage is instantly synced to their account, and is available in the browser, app, and chrome extension on any device. There is no compression or restriction on what kind of file can be transferred which is great when you need full resolution images. There is currently a limit of 200MB per file though.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
  <Image
    src={mobile_example}
    alt="An example of a QR Code Sticker."
    className="h-[600px] w-auto"
  />
</div>


## The Mobile App

The mobile application is built using React Native Expo with some native
libraries to provide additional tools. For example <code>react-native-receive-sharing-intent</code> creates a sharing target so users can share
photos and files directly to the app. It also uses
<code>react-native-document-scanner-plugin</code> to quickly generate
PDF documents from the camera. Whenever I need to scan a document
(copies of licenses, passports, etc.) I almost always use Cross Copy.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
  <VideoPlayer src="/CC_App_Example.mp4" />
</div>

 The Demo above shows a photo being shared to the Cross Copy app, which
is then uploaded to the users cloud storage, and can be accessed from
their browser almost immediately. Mobile to desktop browser sharing 
currently works seamlessly, however I'm still sorting out some issues 
with the application before I release it publically.
