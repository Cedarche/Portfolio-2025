This is the very first project I started back in 2019, and through
it I've learnt to use React, React Native, Node.js, PCB design, and
a range of accessory frameworks.

<Image src={hero} alt="An example of the tile and a digital receipt." />

The concept of Ream is simple, nobody likes paper receipts. While
most people don't give receipts a second thought, I, like many
others, was required to keep a record of all purchases made
through work so they could be expensed back. Simple bank
transaction statements were not enough. I found it astounding that
in 2019, there was no direct interface between the Point of Sale
(POS) systems and the payment processing providers for receipt
data that wasn't just the sales total.

So I decided I would try and build a solution. My initial idea was
some kind of middleware that would integrate with existing POS
software and the customer's banking app to provide an interface
for the receipt data mentioned above (I still think this is the
best solution). However, the industry integrations required for a
system like this seemed too ambitious for a first project.

My next solution was a physical device (think Square Card Reader)
that would sit on a businesses counter top and emulate a standard
bluetooth receipt printer. When a customer made a purchase, their
receipt would be 'printed' to the device which I named the Ream
Tile, which would then make a request to my backend, storing all
necessary information, and returning with a URL. The customer
then taps the Tile with an NFC enabled mobile phone, opens the URL,
and can view/store the digital receipt.

The system I ended up building consists of 4 components:

<ul className="mt-6 space-y-6">
  <li className="flex items-center gap-3">
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Main Web App</strong> - This would
      be the starting point for users, when they first tap a Ream Tile, the
      received URL would render their receipt in the browser as shown below.
      There is a simple interface where users can register an account, then
      store/retrieve their receipts.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Mobile Application</strong> - Using
      deep linking, the same URL can instead open up the receipt in a native
      mobile application, which provides a more fluid experience for the user.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Backend</strong> — All of the
      receipt data received from the POS system is sent from the Tile to the
      server via MQTT. A series of serverless AWS lambda functions then
      store/process the data before returning a URL to the Tile.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <span>
      <strong className="font-semibold">The Hardware</strong> — The Tile itself
      is something I'm quite proud of. It's completely built from scratch, and
      uses a custom PCB that uses an ESP32-C3 microcontroller at it's core. It
      has built in battery management/charging, and a custom housing that can be
      3D printed (or injection moulded).
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>

## The main Ream Website

This was the first website I ever built, so you'll have to excuse some
of the styling. I have refactored it over the years to use typescript,
however much of the original code is fairly low-quality.

<Image src={homepage} alt="The Ream landing page." />

The website is primarily designed to be viewed on mobile, as the
majority of the customers would access it via their digital receipt in
order to learn more about the system. I also built a simple notification
system that would let takeaway venues notify their customers when their
order was ready for collection by updating the receipt, which I called
dynamic receipts. An example of a dynamic digital receipt
can be seen below:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-y-6 sm:flex-row items-center justify-center sm:gap-x-4">

  <Image
    src={dynamic_receipt}
    alt="An example of a dynamic receipt."
    className=" w-[80%] sm:w-[50%] rounded-2xl"
  />
</div>

More than a cursory view of the main website will tell you that it
definitely needs a lot of work. However it does the job as a proof of
concept.

You can view an example receipt <a href="https://ream-1.web.app/receipt/74iUwpl0pjTt9uvva8bH" target="_blank">here</a>.

## The Ream mobile app

Again this was the first mobile application I built with React Native,
so a lot of the code is very average. It was quite a challenge to build
as a beginner, and required the use of some complicated native libraries
such as <code>react-native-ble-plx</code> and <code>react-native-nfc-manager</code>
as well learning the ins and outs of React Navigation's deep linking
schemes in order to fetch then render a digital receipt from a URL that
would also work without the application installed.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
  <VideoPlayer src="/Ream_App_Example.mp4" />
</div>

The application supports login and registration through Email &
Password, Google, Apple, and Facebook to make it as accessible as
possible for users. When a customer that has the App installed taps
their phone to a Ream Tile, they're redirected to the app where the receipt
is automatically stored for future use.

## The Ream Tile

The Tile is simultaneously the most difficult and most rewarding
thing I've ever built. I designed then built every aspect of it from
the ground up, including the housing, circuitry/PCB, and firmware.
For testing and iteration purposes the housing is 3D printed out of
ABS, but I designed it with injection moulding in mind. As a
mechanical engineer this is the one part of the device that I was
already familiar with.

<div className="flex h-[500px] flex-col items-center justify-center rounded-2xl border border-zinc-100 dark:border-zinc-600">
  <Tile_3D />
</div>

At the time of it's construction there were no development boards
available that had the features I needed, so I decided to build my own
custom PCB. I just needed to learn some basic circuit & PCB design,
source the correct components, have the boards manufactured, solder
the ICs, and learn basic C++ and write some firmware - how hard can it
be right?

Six months and around 50 expensive prototypes later I finally landed
on a working design. The core of the system is the Dynamic NFC chip,
which allows you to programmatically store and change the data it
displays. This requires a correctly tuned PCB antenna so that standard
mobile devices can correctly interpret the NFC signal. To control the
IC I use an ESP32-C3 which has WiFi & BLE baked in. Then to power the
whole system I have a LiPo battery and a charge/protection circuit
with a USB-C port.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-x-4 gap-y-4 sm:flex-row">
  <Image
    src={pcb_front}
    alt="The Tile PCB front."
    className="h-[350px] w-auto rounded-2xl"
  />
  <Image
    src={pcb_back}
    alt="The Tile PCB back with PCB antenna."
    className="h-[350px] w-auto rounded-2xl"
  />
</div>

After sorting through issue after issue figuring out the integration
between the housing, PCB, and battery management, I needed to write
the firmware for the device. I won't go into too much detail on this
but it's written in C++ using the ESP-IDF framework specifically
designed for Espressif microcontrollers.

The firmware includes support for both BLE and WiFi, and can
present a receipt URL via either method. When using Bluetooth, the
device provides a GATT Server service which a mobile application can
send data to - a digital receipt URL in this case. When using WiFi,
the device connects to the internet via a local network, then
subscribes to a specific AWS IoT MQTT topic. When a digital receipt is
created by the POS software via the Ream API, it pushes the resulting
receipt URL out to the specified Tile.

After months of integration hell I finally had a fully working system.
You can see an x-ray view of the Tile below, as well as some
functioning prototypes.
